``cmsplugin-simple-markdown`` was originally created in the beginning of 2012 at home,
the bedroom division of the Alireza's place somewhere on planet earth maybe.

The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

* Django & Django contributors
* DjangoCMS & DjangoCMS contributors
* Alireza Savand <alireza.savand@gmail.com>
* François‎


And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown`` that much better:


* Django & Django contributors
* DjangoCMS & DjangoCMS contributors
* Alireza Savand <alireza.savand@gmail.com>
* Philipp Bosch <hello@pb.io>
* Igor Pejic <igor.pejic@dr.com>
* Alex Wright <alex@xeentech.com>
* Jannik Vieten <me@exploide.net>


A big THANK YOU goes to:

* François‎ for convincing Alireza to start the project.
* Guido van Rossum for creating Python.
