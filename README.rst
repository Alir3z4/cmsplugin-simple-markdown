Simple Markdown plugin is just a simple markdown plugin for django-cms.
It's brutally simple. Just a text area and you'll entered some markdown text and save it.
And the reason why I make this is that, I really couldn't find any simple as stupid plugin
for django-cms, all I've found was fancy with a lot of java script stuff.

Configuration
==============

Most people says that installation of cmsplugin-simple-markdown is easy, Seems they're out of space.
It's fucking hard to install.

Configuration & Usage
----------------------

1. Make sure ``django-markdown`` is configured as described in their `Setup
<https://github.com/klen/django_markdown#id5>`_ section.
2. Add ``cmsplugin_simple_markdown`` to  ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
3. If you are using Django 1.7 or higher add ``'cmsplugin_simple_markdown': 'cmsplugin_simple_markdown.migrations_django',`` to ``MIGRATION_MODULES`` in settings.
4. Create the database tables::

    $ python manage.py migrate


This is not easy, It's hard, confusing. I doubt, double doubt that those people that keep saying installing this
is easy are on something.


Drama story
===========
Since every application won't begins with love, this plugin developed to solve a problem.
2 days back, I've been using **cms.plugin.text** for handling html pages and related content,
but when I've tried to use aws s3/cloudfront for my static files, I've stuck with ``CORS`` problem.
So I've develop ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown`` to be used without any deps on js/css files.

Now these days, people all around the world are using it, They are happy with it, They go crazy with ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown``,
Even they name their child ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown``, At least I did. ;)
